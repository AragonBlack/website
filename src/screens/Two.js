          Aragon Black is currently applying to become the third full-time team
          of the <a href="#">Aragon</a> project and take part in its fight for
          freedom and full decentralization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aragon Black is the banner below which the Pando team has gathered to
          continue developing a decentralized VCS enabling coordination and the
          raise of new collaborative projects, to carry the Aragon manifestoâ€™s
          values and finally to help in creating Aragon applications allowing
          human autonomy.

        <p>Welcome</p>
